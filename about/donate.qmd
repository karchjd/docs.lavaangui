### **lavaan is free**

The lavaan package is free (as in beer) and open-source. We very much plan to
keep it that way. But the [bus
factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of the lavaan project is
(currently) one, and the main developer (Yves Rosseel) finds it increasingly
more difficult to find time to maintain (let alone further develop) lavaan.

At the same time, the user base of lavaan is expanding rapidly, and lavaan has
become 'critical software' in many research domains.

This situation is inherently unsustainable, and we are looking for ways to hire
more staff to support the lavaan project. One avenue is to ask for donations.

### **Donations**

From 1 July 2023 onwards, it is possible to donate money to the lavaan project.
The money will go to [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/schenken/en), and
will be used exclusively to hire qualified staff (at the post-doc level) that
will support the lavaan project.

At the end of the year, we will list all individuals/projects/businesses/organizations that have made a donation (unless they opt out) on this website.

### **What are the donations for?**

Our initial goal is to raise about 120,000 euro (the gross salary of a post-doc in Flanders) to hire a qualified person for 1 full year (hopefully, starting early 2024).

This person will assist the main developer to:

1.  create high-quality documentation for users,
2.  create detailed technical documentation (matching the code), and
3.  create a public cloud-based quality-testing platform to ensure the correctness of the lavaan output (in particular after a new update).
4.  add new features to lavaan

### Research project/grant money 

If you have received a research project grant and are currently utilizing
lavaan in your research, we kindly request that you contemplate contributing a
financial contribution to support the lavaan project.

Please be aware that most funding agencies do not permit the use of project
funds for donations. Nevertheless, you have the option to make a voluntary
payment for 'lavaan support,' and we can provide you with an official invoice
upon request. To proceed with this, kindly get in touch with
Isabelle Saelens (email: Isabelle.Saelens@UGent.be), who will provide
you with additional guidance.

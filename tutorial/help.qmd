# Help

If you need help, please open an issue at [https://github.com/karchjd/lavaangui/issues](https://github.com/karchjd/lavaangui/issues) or [email](mailto:j.d.karch@fsw.leidenuniv.nl) me directly.

# Bug

The same applies if you think you have found a bug, or if you have a suggestion for improvement. If you report a bug, always provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). In the case of `lavaangui` this is typically a minimal set of interactions with the app that causes the erorr.

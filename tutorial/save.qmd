After completing an analysis, you may want to save it and share the results.


## Saving the Model

To save the analysis (model and data), use the option `File > Download Model and Data`.
To reload the analysis in the future, use `File > Load Model and Data`. It's also possible to save only the model via `File > Download Model` and load it later using `File > Load Model`.

## Exporting the Diagram

There are two options for exporting the diagram as an image: `File > Export Diagram to PNG` and `File > Export Diagram to JPG`.
